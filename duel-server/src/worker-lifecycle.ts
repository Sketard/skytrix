 * resolves), but everything that wraps the worker handle — attaching the
 * 3 listeners, the idempotent terminate, the `endedAt`/rematch-timer
 * bookkeeping for natural duel-end, the replay-flush request — lives
 * here. Single source of truth for the `workerTerminated` flag and the
 * `totalDuelsServed` counter, both of which had subtle off-by-one races
 * in the pre-extraction inline code (the `exit` handler used to re-count
 * even when `safeTerminateWorker` had already counted).
 *
 * The cross-cutting hooks (`handleWorkerMessage` for routing messages to
 * the player WS, `handleDuelEnd → cleanup` orchestration, rematch timer
 * arming on natural end) are injected at boot via
 * `configureWorkerLifecycle`. This keeps the module decoupled from the
 * WS layer and from `cleanupDuelSession`.
